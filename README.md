# Tree Social Relationship Optimization Algorithm, a metaheuristic Algorithm for solve discrete & continuos problems 


Some of prblems : 

- Antenna Location Problem
- Knapsack Classic Problem
- Robot Path Problem
- TSP Classic Problem
- World Problem (TSP by 10,000 cities)
- Standard benchmark functions (26 function)


for run per problem, you just need go to file and run TSR.m on MATLAB. 
it's should be work on MATLAB and you can see all verbose of iteration, and in end the best answer by graphs show for you.
Enjoy it.
